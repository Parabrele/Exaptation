Instructions: 
Browse the following list of research projects ideas, AI safety projects and pick a subject 
Or propose a subject of your own relevant to AI Safety (some inspiration: Litterature Review)

Write a 2-3 page project proposal that consists of at least: 
A general description of the project.
What problem is the project trying to solve? What does it make progress on?
What experiments could be run?
What are the key uncertainties? 
A bibliography of relevant papers / resources in the field 

If there is no code or maths, the report should be a Google doc. Use latex only if necessary, because the comment feature in Google docs will be useful!
